      "message": "This change will work without https://reviews.llvm.org/D93431, but all of the resulting builtins libraries have non-hidden symbols. I also have platform changes that switch libc.so over to using the exported variants of the builtins archive (for 32-bit) and libunwind (for all archs). I still need to update libm.so.\n\nIf there\u0027s some other reason for needing a builtins library with non-hidden symbols, that would be good to know. AFAIK, the only need for it is libc.so and libm.so, on arm32 and 32-bit x86. (I checked bionic/libc/libc.map.txt and bionic/libm/libm.map.txt against the symbols in the actual archives.)\n",
