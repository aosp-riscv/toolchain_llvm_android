(We also made it possible to set the less misformed version 0xE00 instead of 0x1400 - both should work going forward.)",

      "message": "Specifying both `-lucrt` and `-lucrtbase` is a bit redundant. The former links against the api-ms-win-crt-*.dll, while the latter links against ucrtbase.dll. The total set of symbols exported by both of them should be pretty much equivalent.\n\nWhen linking with MSVC, you in practice end up linking against api-ms-win-crt*.dll, so -lucrt should be the one which is most consistent with that.",
