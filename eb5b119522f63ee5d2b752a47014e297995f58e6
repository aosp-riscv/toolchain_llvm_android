Apparently the test we\u0027d need uses __attribute__((cleanup)) on a C file compiled with -fexceptions. Maybe I can add an NDK test for that.\n\u003e \n\u003e lib/builtins/CMakeLists.txt omits __gcc_personality_v0 because it fails the unwind.h existence check.\n\u003e \n\u003e Clang has an unwind.h that\u0027s installed into its resource directory. (libunwind also has an unwind.h that seems to describe roughly the same API, but I suppose it\u0027s not used by default. libunwind also has a libunwind.h for its unw_* APIs.)\n\u003e \n\u003e CMake compiles a test program, and it\u0027s able to find unwind.h when compiling, but check_include_file tries to link an executable, and it can\u0027t, so it declares the header missing.\n\u003e \n\u003e By using -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_WORKS\u003dON to bypass the CMake feature testing, I was doing the same thing I saw the Fuchsia LLVM build system do. (I think it\u0027s using the llvm_ExternalProject_Add calls in llvm/runtimes/CMakeLists.txt to build the builtins.) It appears that the Fuchsia libclang_rt.builtins.a archives are also missing the __gcc_personality_v0 symbols, also because unwind.h is \"missing\". (As of mid-May, anyway.)\n\u003e \n\u003e One easy fix for Android LLVM is to pass -DHAVE_UNWIND_H\u003dON to cmake for the builtins. We could also change compiler-rt to explicitly turn HAVE_UNWIND_H on for Android.\n\n-DCMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE\u003dSTATIC_LIBRARY seems like a better approach. It configures CMake to skip linking during its feature testing (try_compile). The flag also makes -DCMAKE_C_COMPILER_WORKS\u003dON unnecessary.\n",

      "message": "Thank for the heads up, we don\u0027t need __gcc_personality_v0 on Fuchsia which is why we haven\u0027t noticed this issue. I agree that CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE would be better but it\u0027s not supported by CMake 3.4 which is currently the minimum supported by LLVM. What I think we should do is to move this check to https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/master/compiler-rt/cmake/builtin-config-ix.cmake and use a custom function akin to builtin_check_c_compiler_flag that doesn\u0027t attempt to link.",

      "message": "This AOSP patch builds the builtins by invoking cmake on lib/builtins, so AFAICT, it can use CMAKE_TRY_COMPILE_TARGET_TYPE despite the current 3.4 version minimum.

      "message": "It seems that libomp calls some functions from the builtins library, where the libclang_rt.builtins versions of those builtins depend on libm functions (whereas libgcc did not need libm).\n\nOn arm32, there are unresolved references while attempting to link libomp.so. They involve complex-FP math:\n\n - __divsc3 builtin calls fmaxf and scalbnf.\n - __divdc3 builtin calls fmax and scalbn.\n\nThe code in compiler-rt/lib/builtins doesn\u0027t directly call the libm functions. Instead, it calls crt_{fmax,scalbn}[f] functions, which are macros for __builtin_fmax[f] or __builtin_scalbn[f]. Clang turns the __builtin_*  calls into calls to the libm functions.\n\nThe dependency on libm did seem odd to me. Depending on target and optimization level, Clang sometimes inlines the __builtin_fmax[f] call. AFAICT, it doesn\u0027t ever inline the __builtin_scalbn[f] call. I think scalbn[f] more-or-less just increments the exponent field of the FP value, so maybe it could be inlined into the builtins archive.\n\nThe functions are defined in int_math.h. Maybe the libm dependency is unintended?\n\n    // This file defines substitutes for the libm functions used in some of the\n    // compiler-rt implementations, defined in such a way that there is not a direct\n    // dependency on libm or math.h. Instead, we use the compiler builtin versions\n    // where available. This reduces our dependencies on the system SDK by foisting\n    // the responsibility onto the compiler.\n\nI also see a call from __divsc3 to __compiler_rt_logbf, which calls __compiler_rt_logbX:\n\n    // Implements logb methods (logb, logbf, logbl) for IEEE-754. This avoids\n    // pulling in a libm dependency from compiler-rt, but is not meant to replace\n    // it (i.e. code calling logb() should get the one from libm, not this), hence\n    // the __compiler_rt prefix.\n    static __inline fp_t __compiler_rt_logbX(fp_t x) {\n\nI know of two places where the builtins library depends on libc, and both are marginal:\n\n - __compilerrt_abort_impl calls abort, but it\u0027s very target-specific. e.g. Fuchsia replaces the abort call with __builtin_trap.\n\n - __eprintf references fprintf, fflush, and stderr. The comments say it was used to implement assert once upon a time, but I don\u0027t know if that has ever been relevant to Android.",

AFAICT, x86_64 glibc\u0027s libc provides scalbn but not fmax. (I checked both libc.so.6 and libc_nonshared.a.) For Bionic, neither function is in libc.
