This is also where my CL doing something similar got stuck, as I was trying to ensure that my change was a nop to the `PATCHES.json` file.",

      "message": "This matches the existing behavior of `end_version` which is also Optional and of which a few patches in this json file have `end_version: null`.\n\nWe could change cherrypick_cl.py to omit the fields when either values are `None`/`null`, but we should be consistent IMO between these two optional fields, and there\u0027s little benefit IMO; maybe less churn over time in the PATCHES.json file, but it is autogenerated.  The current method is perhaps more consistent from a scheme perspective.\n\nThe issue you were likely hitting was that there\u0027s a bootstrapping/chicken+egg problem here; see v1 of this patch for how I solved that; but that approach isn\u0027t necessary once PATCHES.json has been updated once.",
